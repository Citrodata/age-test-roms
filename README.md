# AGE test roms

These Game Boy test roms were written to complement other test suites.

# Build

You need [RGBDS](https://rgbds.gbdev.io) to `make` these roms.

# Development

In my experience [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
combined with the [RGBDS GBZ80 plugin](https://github.com/DonaldHays/rgbds-vscode)
is your best choice.

# Font

AGE test roms use a slightly modified version of the
[small blocky font](https://opengameart.org/content/small-blocky-font)
originally created by [Jerom](https://opengameart.org/users/jerom).
